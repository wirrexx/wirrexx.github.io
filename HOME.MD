**Hi** My name is Wisam Petros Odish, I am a father of **two** beautiful kids, my oldest one, a girl named Kiara and my youngest one, a boy named Keanu. 

I'm currently happy learning Python backend, although we are still on fundemamentals on how stuff work inside of Linux and the beautiful **Terminal** it comes with. 

My goal at the end of my study, is simply to have at least 2 working projects, one intermediate and one advanced. 

As I have a background as a 3D artist in the game industry, I would love to create tools that artist can make use off! Here are some of the stuff I am allowed to show from my experience [Portfolio](https://www.artstation.com/wirrexx/albums/all).

But my future goal is to use my newly learned coding skills and create Plugins for tools that i use (Automation), and maybe, just maybe, mobile game for kids. 

During my **freetime**, you will find me in the gym, watching sports, playing games or ***spending my time with my kids and fianc√©e!***

So lets sum it up:
- Wisam is the name
- Two kids, one girl & one boy
- Currently studying 
- Goal is to improve each day
- Background as a 3D artist in Gamedev
- Love family, sports and gaming!
