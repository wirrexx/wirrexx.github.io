    <div class="about"><p><strong>Hi</strong> My name is Wisam Petros Odish, I am a father of <strong>Two</strong> beautiful kids, my oldest one, a girl named Kiara and my youngest one, a boy named Keanu. 

        I'm currently happy learning Python backend, although we are still on fundemamentals on how stuff work inside of Linux and the beautiful <strong>Terminal</strong> it comes with. 
        
        My goal at the end of my study, is simply to have at least 2 working projects, one intermediate and one advanced. 
        
        But my future goal is to use my newly learned coding skills and create Plugins for tools that i use (Automation), and maybe, just maybe, mobile game for kids. 
        
        During my <em>freetime</em>, you will find me in the gym, watching sports, playing games or spending my time with my kids and <strong>fianc√©e!</strong></p>
